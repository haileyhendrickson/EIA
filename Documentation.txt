Talked to Justin F about the desire for an EIM API program that allows for custom dates, time zone, and 
balancing authority. Got registered for the API and got a super basic query going. Not sure if I have all the right parameters, but
I can worry about that later.
Also curious if I need to worry about the 5000 row limit, or if is unlikely someone will need that many rows (esp if it is monthly)
Tried adding timezone options into parameters. They ran, but didn't actually pull the different time. Might have to do it a different way.

Discovered that only the UTC time is working for the eia pulls. 

7/7-
Fixed and added all timezones.
Fixed the hours issues, so they line up with the requested date range, despite timezone shifts

7/8-
Fixed indexing error. Justin F approves! Uploaded to sharepoint with installation instructions.
