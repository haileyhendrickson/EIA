Talked to Justin F about the desire for an EIM API program that allows for custom dates, time zone, and 
balancing authority. Got registered for the API and got a super basic query going. Not sure if I have all the right parameters, but
I can worry about that later.
Also curious if I need to worry about the 5000 row limit, or if is unlikely someone will need that many rows (esp if it is monthly)
